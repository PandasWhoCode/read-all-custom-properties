# README for the project Read All Custom Properties

**Read all custom properties and values from all repos in the organization and write to a file.**

This action uses the GitHub CLI to read all properties from all repos in the organization. It can write
the results to a `repo-properties.yaml` file as well, for use with input to 
[update custom properties](https://github.com/PandasWhoCode/update-custom-properties) action.
